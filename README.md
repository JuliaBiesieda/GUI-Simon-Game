# GUI Simon Game

#### Description:
Recently I have failed in memory exam of a famous coding school here in Lisbon and failed and decided to challenge
myself and create a game to improve my memory skills. 
So I created Simon game. It's the electronic game of lights and sounds in which player must repeat random
sequences of flashing lights by pressing the colored pads in the correct order. 

To create the game I used the GUI system and python code (main.py file). I also used some vector graphics to make
the multiple color buttons (images folder) and sounds (sounds folder) to make the game more interactive. 
In this version, there's no way to win the game. Itâ€™s infinite, and you just keep playing until you mess up.

In my code, I used functions and basic tkinter interface like canvas, buttons and labels, playsound module to play music
and random module to pick a random color from the list.
